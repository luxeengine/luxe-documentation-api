In your project, you can make more files to separate your code.
Project scripts are imported as an absolute id, relative to the project root.

If you create a file called `player.wren` inside the root of your project, 
you can import it with `import "player" for Player` at the top of `game.wren`.

:::note
- There's no `wren`extension
- There's no _luxe module_ prefx (`luxe: string`) 
- There's no dot-slash like `./player`, imports are project relative
:::

If you created that file inside of a folder, like `player/logic/backpack.wren`, you would use `import "player/logic/backpack" for Backpack`. 

You always use that import id, even if you were inside a script in the `player/logic/` folder.
