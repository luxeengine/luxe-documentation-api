title: Modules
description: Using import for multiple wren files

In your project folder, there is a file called `luxe.project/modules.lx`. 
Dependencies on modules can be added to this file, or added via the launcher. 
[The world tutorial covers this](/getting-started/world/). 

For example, if you were using a module called `arcade` at version `0.0.24` it would look like this:

```js
  modules = {
    luxe = "2025.6.5"
    arcade = "0.0.24"
  } //modules
```
